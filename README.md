A Drink Around Here is a brewery search application.  When the user inputs their location, it will display information on breweries nearby.  Clicking onto a listed brewery opens a window with location information, and it also searches the area for entertainment events the user might be interested in and will also display the current weather.

Technologies Used:
 - APIs: OpenBreweryDB, Ticketmaster, OpenWeather
 - Libraries: Zurb Foundation, jQuery, Leaflet CSS and JS

Future Development:
 - Always room for visual improvement.
 - Incorporate information on beers available at each brewery.
 - Find a way to display food offerings in the area.
