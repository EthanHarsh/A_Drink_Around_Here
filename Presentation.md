#Elevator Pitch: One minute description of your application
##Our application is a Brewery search application.  This uses Leaflet API to establish where the user wants to search for breweries in the area.  This also uses weather API to determine how the weather is or will be in that area.  We are also using an events API to see if there are any events at or near the area as well.  

#Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
##The user is a person who has several reasons to use the application.  One would be to visit a brewery either new or one they have been to, and would like to check the location, weather and events.  Another would be for a person visiting another location, and would like to find breweries in that area, along with checking the weather and events.  
###The motivation for our group was trying to find something we could all have at least a little interest in.  Location is always a popular use for applications, so using it for this particular purpose helped us all come together and establish and learn as a group.  

#Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
1. We used 3 APIs.  Leaflet for the maps, openweatherapp API, and _____ for brewery information.  
The beginning tasks were easy to hand out, as we had the design, and 3 different APIs to research and code.  As each task was completed, as a group we determined what was the next step, and handed it out to whoever could start it.

#Directions for Future Development
1. Always room for visual improvement.
2. I think adding to the map in the future will be helpful.

#Add links to deployed app and GitHub Repo
